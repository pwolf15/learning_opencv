OpenCV
* CV resources: Trucco, Forsyth, Hartley, Faugeras
* 3D inputs to 2D representation =>  lighting, weather, reflections, movements, lens imperfections, mechanical setup, finite integration time, electrical noies, compression artifacts => solutions: contextual knowledge, where we expect objects to occur, what size is implicit, machine learning techniques, statistical methods to reduce noise, time-lapse based methods like background subtraction
* downsampling an image
* sample space / image pyramid
* Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem
* pyrDown => Gaussian blurring, down sampling
* traits in C++, variable introspection, 
* matrix inversion via: Cholesky, LU, and SVD decomposition
* saturation casting
* MatExpr

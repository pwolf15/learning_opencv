Hey /u/john-dev, Adrian here, I'm the author of PyImageSearch. You should always feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions on CV, DL, or the best path to follow. I'm here to help and I'm more than happy to recommend tutorials, books, or courses, regardless of whether or not they are my own.

As far as your motivations go, from reading this post it sounds like CV/DL is just a hobby for you, correct? And currently you are trying to validate whether or not this area is worth the investment of your time and finances? I get the impression that you aren't planning on a career change. Is my understanding correct here? Let me know and I can provide more targeted suggestions.

There's a few things to understand here. If you would like to study the intersection of CV and DL you should, at the very least, learn the fundamentals of image processing and computer vision. You don't need a super deep understanding but a little bit of CV basics goes along way. It helps you identify when it's appropriate to apply DL and when a clever use of basic CV concepts will solve the problem for you. How far have you gotten in the OpenCV docs? Are you feeling comfortable there?

I saw from a previous thread here (I looked it up after you mentioned posting before) that you read this tutorial on deep learning object detection and are now looking to train your own models.

Before you start training your own object detectors/localizers I would first recommend getting your feet wet by training an image classifier. Image classifiers are easier to conceptualize and train when you are first getting started. Once you understand classification you should move on to object detection/localization.

I have a number of tutorials on training your own custom models on the PyImageSearch blog, but the latest one is:

The best part about that post is that it's also part of a series on:

    Building your own deep learning (image) dataset

    Training the model (linked to above)

    Deploying to iOS

    Running your model on the Raspberry Pi

It's a fun series. You get to learn in a hands-on manner and you don't even have to use the datasets I provide if you don't want to.

Like I said, always feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you need help on your CV/DL journey. The best place to reach me is via email. If you already have my email, great! Otherwise shoot me a message on the PyImageSearch contact form.

You can message me here on reddit as well but depending on the complexity of the question (i.e,. whether or not I can answer it in 2-3 sentences) I may refer you to my email. I receive lots of notifications per day across my social media accounts so I normally like to have all messages in my inbox so I don't lose track of it (and ensuring I can get back to you in a timely manner).
